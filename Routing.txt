Routing 

IP routing is the process of moving packets across a network from one host to another that performed by routers. Routing work by
each host has a special list of routing rules which called routing table. The table contains rows of three filed; destination 
address, name of the interface to which the datagram is to be routed, and IP address of another machine that carry the datagram
on it next step through the network. To display this routing table use one of the following commands "User% cat /proc/net/route", 
"user% /sbin/route -n", and "user% netstat -r". The process of routing first there is an incoming datagram is received, the 
destination address is examined, and the last is to compare with each entry in the table. Route is a command that takes command 
line arguments and convert them into kernel system call that request the kernel to add, delete, or modify entries in the routing 
table. Use this command you'll be able to configure routing. However, the problem is with manual routing or static routing. Those
can cause machine or link fails in your network. Here are some example of routing protocols; routed' -RIP and gated' -RIP, and 
OSPF. the important points relating to dtnamic routing are run dynamic routing protcol daemon, automatically modify routing,
and RIP os suited to small to medium sized networks.
