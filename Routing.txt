Routing 

IP routing is the process of moving packets across a network from one host to another that performed by routers. Routing work by
each host has a special list of routing rules which called routing table. The table contains rows of three filed; destination 
address, name of the interface to which the datagram is to be routed, and IP address of another machine that carry the datagram
on it next step through the network. To display this routing table use one of the following commands "User% cat /proc/net/route", 
"user% /sbin/route -n", and "user% netstat -r". The process of routing first there is an incoming datagram is received, the 
destination address is examined, and the last is to compare with each entry in the table.
