Tcpdump 

Tcpdump is a tool used by security professionals for premier network analysis. This tool displays network tracff a more natural 
way the burden of analsis is placed directly on the human rather than the application. Using this tools, it's help to 
understanding of TCP/IP. 

Options when cofiguring tcpdump:
-i any: Listen to all interfaces just to see if you're seeing any traffic.
-i eth0: Listen to the eth0 interface.
-D: Show the list available interfaces
-n: Dont resolve hostnames.
-nn: Don't resolve hostnames or port names.
-q: Be less verbose (more quiet) with your output.
-t: Give human-readable timestamp output.
-ttt: Give maximally human-reable timestamp output.
-X: Show the packet's contents in both HEX and ASCII.
-XX: Same as -X, but also shows the ethernet header.
-v, -vv, -vvv: Increase the amount of packet information yuou get back.
-c: Only get x number of packets and then stop.
-s: Define the snaplength(size) of the capture in bytes.  Use -s0 to get everything, unless you are intentionally capturing less.
-S: Print absolute sequence numbers.
-e: Get the ethernet header as well.
-q: Show less protocol information.
-E: Decript IPSEC traffic by providing an encryption key.

Expressions allow you to trim out various types of traffic and find exactly what you're looking for.
The three main tyoes od expression: type, dir, and proto.
- Types: host, net, and port.
- Direction: src, dst, and combinations thereor.
- Proto(col): tcp, udp, icmp, ah, and many more.

Some examples:
# tcpdump -i any 
# tcpdump -i eth0 
# tcpdump src 2.3.4.5
# tcpdump dst 3.3.4.5
